# OpenGL

The main working code is sample.cpp. Most of the other files are its dependencies or required libraries.

To test the program on your local machine, first run "make sample" and then "./sample"

To test out my works from projects (that I uploaded on YT), go to "projects" folder and copy the code from any of the project you want to test out and paste it into sample.cpp. Then you would follow the same instruction above to run it. 
This is the easiest way to go about this due to some circumstances.
